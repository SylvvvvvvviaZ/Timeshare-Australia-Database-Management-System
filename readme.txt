Create, populate and manipulate a database which can be used to support the activities of a holiday timeshare system - TimeShare Australia. 
Timeshare is a holiday system that permits members to purchase (own) a set amount of time (in the form of points) at a particular resort that they can use for holidays every year as a lifetime commitment. Through TimeShare Australia members of a particular resort can convert their purchase into a holiday at other resorts which are part of the system.
